     <p><strong>Determination  of Wet Kata cooling power and establishment of the relationship between Kata  cooling power and air velocity.</strong></p>
     <p> <br />
        <strong><u>Objective:</u></strong><br />
       The  purpose of this experiment is to get familiarized with Kata thermometer and its  operation, and then estimation of cooling power of any working environment. In  addition this experiment also addresses how the wet bulb temperature (TW)  and velocity of air (v) influence the cooling power of the air.<br />
        <strong><u>Theory:</u></strong><br />
       There  are few heat stress indices found in the literature to assess the climatic  condition of an working environment such as: Dry bulb temperature and Wet bulb  temperature, Effective temperature, Air cooling power measured by Kata  thermometer, wet bulb globe temperature, specific cooling power etc. In fact, sometimes  wet bulb temperature alone is used as a heat stress indicator to assess the  climatic condition. <br />
       The  cooling power of any mine air depends mainly on the wet bulb temperature (TW)  and the air velocity (v). The dry-bulb temperature (TD) affects the  cooling power only a little, except in cases of high dry bulb temperature  coupled with low wet bulb temperature and high air velocity. So, the cooling  power of mine air on the human body can be expressed in terms of wet bulb  temperature and air velocity (Misra, 1985). The Kata thermometer is developed  in early 1916 and used to estimate cooling power of air. A design aspect of Kata  thermometer taken from Misra (1985) is given below <br />

         Kata  thermometer (Figure 1) is a glass thermometer with a bulb of 40mm long and 20mm  diameter filled with colored alcohol connected to a 200mm long stem having two  smaller bulbs or reservoirs at the top and at the bottom ends. The stem has two  marks one at 35&deg;C and another at 38&deg;C. When taking a reading with  the Kata thermometer, the bulb is first heated by dipping it in hot water so  the alcohol rises to the top reservoir. The bulb is then taken out of water and  wiped with a dry cloth and is allowed to cool in the air. The time taken by  thermometer to cool from 38&deg;C to 35&deg;C is noted. The Kata cooling factor which  gives the amount of heat loss per cm2 from the surface of the bulb  in cooling from 38&deg;C to 35&deg;C is usually written on the Kata thermometer. This  factor divided by the time taken for the cooling gives the estimate of Kata  cooling power of air. <br />
         Kata  thermometer can be used to estimate dry Kata cooling power as well as wet Kata  cooling power. However, the dry-Kata reading gives an estimate of the heat loss  from the surface of the bulb due to radiation, convection and hence it is of  little importance, particularly under hot and humid conditions where most of  the heat loss from the human body is through evaporation. So, the wet Kata  cooling power is mostly used in practical cases. The wet Kata reading is obtained  by covering the bulb of the Kata thermometer by wet muslin. The idea is to make  it resemble the human body which loses heat by radiation, convection and  evaporation. <br />
         The  Wet Kata cooling power (K) is seen to be related with the wet-bulb temperature  (TW) and the air velocity (v). An empirical relationship between Kata  cooling power with the wet bulb temperature and air velocity is cited in the  mine ventilation book of Misra (1985). This empirical relationship is given  below:<br />

  &nbsp;A moderately working man usually produces  about 165Wm-2 of waste heat which has to be dissipated.&nbsp; In other words, a Kata value of 165Wm-2  should be sufficient for cooling a moderate worker, but it has been found that  the rate of cooling of Kata thermometer is much faster compared to human body,  i.e. the cooling air is not 100% efficient for the human body as compared to Kata  thermometer. This is due to the fact that the Kata thermometer is much smaller  compared to human body and has a smaller volume to surface area ratio. Also, the  convection co-efficient of Kata thermometer is twice than that of human body.  The body surface is rarely completely sweat covered as the wet Kata  thermometer. Because of the clothing, air cannot get access to the whole body  surface. Besides, the factor of acclimatization of human too contributes to the  difference between the cooling effect of mine air on the Kata thermometer and  the human body. &nbsp;From several book, it  has been seen that Kata cooling efficiency of air at only 20% which means that  for comfortable working, the minimum wet-Kata cooling power reading should be  165*5=825 Wm-2. <br />
         This  experiment is designed to evaluate Kata cooling power of air in certain  environment and also to examine the variation of cooling power with the change  of air velocity.

         Fig:  One minute vane anemometer<br />
         A  one minute vane anemometer consists of a small windmill with vanes set an angle  of 0.785 radians to the direction of air flow which rotates the vanes at a  speed proportional to the air velocity. The no. of revolutions converted to a  scale of distance traversed by the air recorded in set of counting dials  operated through gears. The air velocity can be obtained by dividing this  reading by the duration of one minute. The commonly used anemometer is the  Biram type which is 100-112 mm in diameter with centrally placed counting  dials. There is small clutch which can be operated to engage the wheel with the  counting system while measuring the air velocity. A resetting device brings  back the reading to zero. Provision can be made for mounting the anemometer on  a shaft for more accurate measurements away from the body. In such cases,  arrangements are made to operate the clutch from a distance by means of a metal  rod.<br />
