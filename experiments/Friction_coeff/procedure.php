     <ol>
       <li>Dimension  of the duct are noted with a measuring tape (length, breadth and height).</li>
       <li>Inclined  tube manometer is leveled and connected to the duct so that the pressure drop will  be recorded.</li>
       <li>As  the air is following with a speed, the pressure drop is noted from inclined  tube manometer.</li>
       <li>At  the same time, velocity of air flow is measured by continuous traverse of vane  anemometer at one end of the duct.</li>
       <li>A  graph has to be plotted for the &Delta;P  vs. (S V2 / A) values recorded for different air flow rates. The  frictional coefficient will be calculated from the slope of the grape. In this  way the frictional coefficient will be determined graphically from the above  experimented result. </li>
