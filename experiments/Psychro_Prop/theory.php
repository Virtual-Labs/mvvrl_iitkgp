    <p><strong>Familiarization  with Assmann psychrometer and estimation of psychrometric properties of air. </strong><br />
       </p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;<u>Objective: </u></strong><br />
      Estimation  of psychrometric properties of air relevant to climatic conditions of an  environment and acquire skill for handling Assmann psychrometer.<br />
  </p>
    <p><strong><u>Theory:</u></strong><br />
      Temperature  and humidity of air determine the climatic condition of work environment. As  the climatic condition becomes more hot and humid, the work efficiency of the workers  reduces. More over workers may feel tired which may lead to accident  occasionally, and in extreme cases fatality may occur due to heat stress. Hence  determining the psychrometric properties of air which are related to heat and  humidity condition is very important to assess the quality of work space  environment. The following psychrometric properties are relevant for  determining climatic conditions.</p>

     <p><strong>Dry Bulb Temperature (TD)</strong><br />
       The  dry-bulb temperature is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air" title="Air">air</a> measured by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer" title="Thermometer">thermometer</a> freely exposed to the air but shielded from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture" title="Moisture">moisture</a>. Dry bulb temperature is the temperature that is  usually thought of as air temperature, and it is the true thermodynamic  temperature. It is the temperature measured by a regular thermometer exposed to  the airstream. The dry-bulb temperature is an indicator of heat content in the  air. <strong> </strong><br />
        </p>
     <p><strong>Wet Bulb  Temperature (</strong><strong>TW</strong><strong>)</strong><br />
        <strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is the temperature recorded by a thermometer  whose bulb is covered with a thin cotton gauge which is dipped at the lower end  into water so that the surface of the bulb is kept moist by capillary action.<strong> </strong>If such a  thermometer is placed in unsaturated air, the wet bulb of the thermometer will  lose latent heat in the process of evaporation of moisture surrounded with the  bulb. &nbsp;As a result, the temperature of  the bulb will fall. &nbsp;Once the air is  saturated, there will be no further evaporation and cooling of the thermometer, then  it will show a constant temperature. This temperature is called Wet bulb  temperature (TW). Thus, the wet bulb temperature (TW), in  conjunction with the dry bulb temperature (TD), gives a measure of  the degree of saturation or the Relative Humidity (RH) of air <br />
        </p>
     <p><strong>Saturated  Vapour Pressure</strong><br />
      At a particular temperature, Saturated Vapour  Pressure (e1) is the maximum pressure that can be exerted by the  water vapour in a saturated atmosphere or space. The commonly accepted equation  for SVP (e1) at temperature t&deg;C is:</p>
     <p align="center"><br />
        <img src="theory_clip_image002.gif" alt="23" width="138" height="30" align="absmiddle" />&nbsp;in kPa<br />
          </p>
     <p><strong>Vapour  Pressure</strong><br />
      This is the partial pressure of water vapour present  in a certain volume of air (or space) expressed in kPa. This is also called  Actual Vapour Pressure (AVP). If TD and TW &nbsp;are known, AVP (e) can be found out  approximately &nbsp;from this equation:</p>

        Where, <img src="theory_clip_image006.gif" alt="56" width="18" height="22" />&nbsp;is SVP at the  wet bulb temperature in kPa<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; P is the  barometric pressure in kPa</p>
     <p><strong>Relative Humidity (RH)</strong><br />
       It is the ratio  of actual vapour pressure (AVP) to the saturated vapour pressure (SVP) at the  given dry bulb temperature, expressed as a percentage, i.e</p>

     <p><br />
        <strong>Specific  Humidity (SP)</strong><br />
       This is the mass of water vapour present in kg per  kg of moist air<strong></strong></p>
     <p align="center"><br />
        <img src="theory_clip_image010.gif" alt="55" width="134" height="39" align="absmiddle" /> </p>
     <p><br />
        <strong>Mixing  ratio (M)</strong> <br />
       This is the ratio of mass of water vapour present to  the unit of mass of dry air.</p>
     <p align="center"><br />
        <img src="theory_clip_image012.gif" alt="78" width="114" height="25" /> </p>
     <p><br />
       This is often termed as moisture content in kg of  moisture per kg of dry air.</p>
     <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Dew  Point temperature</strong> <br />
      The temperature at which the air attains saturation  is known as its dew point. It is used to indicate the moisture content of air.</p>
     <p><br />
        <strong>Enthalpy</strong><br />
      Enthalpy (sometimes  called total heat) is defined by the equation:</p>
     <p><br />
        <img src="theory_clip_image014.gif" alt="65" width="99" height="22" /> <br />

     <p>Various  instruments are used to measure the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperature of  air.&nbsp; Among them, Whirling hygrometer and  Assmann Psychrometer are most common.&nbsp;  The atmospheric pressure can be measured with the help of Fortin barometer  or Aneroid barometer. Once, the dry bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature and  barometric pressure are measured, all the psychrometric properties are  determined using those measured values.&nbsp;&nbsp;  A brief overview of these instruments is provided below.</p>
     <p><strong><em>Whirling  Hygrometer or Sling Psychrometer</em></strong> <br />
       This  instrument consists of a wet-bulb thermometer and a dry-bulb thermometer.&nbsp; These two thermometers are fastened on cork  mounted in a wooden frame with arrangement for rotating the same to provide a  relative movement of air around the thermometer bulbs. The two bulbs are placed  in such a way that the evaporative cooling and moisture from wet-bulb do not  affect the dry bulb. It is provided with a handle for whirling the instrument  such that continuous rotation of the bulb causes the fresh air to pick up  moisture surrounding the wet-bulb. The instrument is rotated at the rate of  20rad/s so that relative air velocity of 3m/s can be maintained. The least  count of this instrument is 1&deg;C.<br />

                                         <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
     <p><strong><em>Assmann Psychrometer</em></strong><br />
       Assmann  psychrometer is similar to whirling hygrometer by operational principle.  However, two thermometers in this psychrometer are ventilated by a fan operated  by a clock-type spring. The fan should be run for 3 minutes before taking a  reading. Chromium-plated metal sleeves of the bulbs prevent radiation from  surroundings. The least count of the Assmann psychrometer is 0.2&deg;C. So, this  instrument is five times more accurate than whirling hygrometer.<br />

      <p><strong><em>Fortin Barometer</em></strong> <br />
      It  is an instrument which works on mercury level measurement. It has a long glass tube,  filled with mercury. &nbsp;The height of  mercury column which indicates the pressure can be read from the scale on brass  tube. As atmospheric pressure changes, the mercury level in the cistern changes  accordingly. For example, an increase in atmospheric pressure causes the  mercury level to rise. The mercury is contained within a flexible pouch and  screw jack causing the level either to rise or fall. By moving the screw of  vernier, the top of the column is matched with the lower edge of the vernier  and the reading is then taken from main scale and vernier scale. The mercury is  toxic; hence, direct contact should be avoided while using the instrument. When  adjusting the mercury level to point zero, the adjusting screw should not be  turned too quickly and if the mercury has been moved through a large amount,  the instrument should be left to settle before making the final setting.</p>

     <p><strong><em>Aneroid Barometer</em></strong> <br />
       An  aneroid barometer uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell. This  cell is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule is  presented from collapsing by a string spring. Small changes in the outside air cause  the box to expand or contract. Small levers, present in the barometer amplify  the small changes and cause the needle to show the pressure. The mechanism is  made deliberately &quot;stiff&quot; so that, tapping the barometer reveals  whether the barometer is rising or falling as the pointer moves.<br />
