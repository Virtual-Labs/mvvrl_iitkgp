     <p><strong><u>PROCEDURE</u></strong></p>
     <p>The following procedures are to be followed by the user in order to calibrate the askania minimeter readings: &nbsp;</p>
     <ol type="1">
       <li>
         <p>The inclined manometer should be levelled by adjusting the screws   at the base of the manometer and with the help of a spirit level.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The inclination should be measured with respect to the horizontal line.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The Askania minimeter has to be levelled using the spherical spirit level at the base.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>All have to be connected at the junction, as indicated.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The inverted funnel should be dipped into water in the water   reservoir. Then water is to be added in steps and removed in steps for   varying the pressure head.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The top knob should be turned appropriately so that the pin heads match in the Askania minimeter.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The readings from Asksnia minimeter, DPCalc (in kPa) and the   inclined tube manometer (in mm) have to be noted under respective   variable in the prescirbed table.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>A plot of the readings taken from the Askania minimeter vs. the   Inclined tube manometer ; and DPCalc vs. inclined tube manometer has to   be &nbsp;plotted.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The equations of both the plots should be found out the calculated one and compared one.</p>
         <p>The least counts of&nbsp;the two&nbsp;instruments used here are as mentioned below:</p>
         <p><br />
           Askania minimeter = 0.01 mm WG</p>
         <p>Inclined tube manometer = 0.1 cm WG</p>
         <p>DPCalc = 0.1 Pa</p>
       </li>
     </ol>
