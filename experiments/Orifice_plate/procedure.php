     <p><strong>Procedure:</strong><br />
The  experiment entitled &ldquo;Calibration of orifice plate&rdquo; is performed into different  steps which are listed below.</p>
     <ol>
     <ul>
       <li>Fan  in the duct will be started.</li>
       <li>Speed  of the air at another end of the duct will be measured by anemometer by  traversing method.</li>
       <li>&nbsp;Pressure difference will be taken at two  places by the U tube manometer as described in Figure1. The places are before  orifice plate and after orifice plate. </li>
       <li>Area  of the duct opening will be measured from the diameter of the duct by measuring  tape.</li>
       <li>The  quantity of the air following through the duct will be varying by changing the  throttling devices which are place at the side of the duct where the fan is  situated into the duct.</li>
       <li>Five  reading i.e. air velocity and pressure different will be taken by varying air  quantity with changing the throttling device.</li>
     </ul>
