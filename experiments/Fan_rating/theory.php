     <p><strong>Fan  rating test</strong><br />
</p>
     <p><strong>Objective:</strong><br />
  &nbsp;The objective of the experiment is the  determination of fan characteristics such as finding out the fan static and  total pressures, power input to the fan and total efficiency of the fan for  various flow rates at the rated speed.</p>
     <p><br />
        <strong>Theory  and Procedure:</strong><br />
       The  standard test set-up suitable for fans with both inlet and outlet ducts or with  outlet duct only. In the case of fans with inlet duct only, the set-up would be  slightly modified with the test duct on the inlet of the fan. For fans with no  inlets and outlet ducts, the test set-up incorporates a chamber, but this test is  not usually necessary for mine fans since most mine fans are installed with  inlet and outlet ducts.<br />
       The test  duct has a minimum length of 10 diameters and is connected to the outlet of the  fan by a connecting piece whose sides should not converge at an angle greater  than 0.26 rad (15&omicron;) or diverge at an angle exceeding 0.123 rad (7&omicron;).  The diameter of the duct should be such that its cross-sectioal area does not  exceed that of the fan outlet by more than 12.5% nor should it be less than the  cross sectional area at the fan outlet by more than 7.5%. The duct should be  straight and of perfect shape. The tolerable limit of roundness for circular  ducts at the traverse section is &plusmn;0.5% of the diameter and this limit should  hold good for a distance of at least D/2 on either side of the traverse plane. An  egg-crate straightener (figure 2) is used in the duct for straightening air  flow. A diffuser cone (as shown by dotted lines in figure 1) at the outlet end  of the duct may be used in order to approach more nearly free delivery  conditions. The dotted line at the fan inlet indicates an inlet bell which may  be used to simulate inlet duct condition. The friction loss in the inlet bell however  is not considered in test calculations. Variation of quantity circulated by the  fan is done by a symmetrical throttling device provided at the outlet of the  duct. </p>

       Rating  test aims at finding out the fan static and total pressures, power input to the  fan and total efficiency of the fan for various flow rates at the rated speed  so that the fan characteristics can be drawn. Static efficiency may also be  calculated. With variable speed fans, all these readings are taken for  different fan speeds. The results are stated for the inlet air density during  the test. The necessary measurements are (a) static pressure and (b) velocity  pressure (from which the velocity and hence the quantity can be calculated) at  the traverse section, (c) the rotational speed of the fan, (d) power input to  the fan, (e) barometric pressure, (f) dry and wet-bulb temperatures on the path  of the inflowing air and (g) dry bulb temperature at the traverse section.<br />
       The  static pressure and the velocity pressure are measured by a pilot-static tube  connected to two manometers as shown in figure 1. Pressures greater than 500 Pa  are usually measured by vertical U-tube water gauges graduated in millimeters  whereas lower pressures should be measured on an inclined manometer having a  least reading of 1-2.5 Pa. The inclined manometer should be calibrated against  a sensitive micro-manometer. The pilot-static tube should be of the standard  hemispherical-head type to be described later. It should not have a stem  diameter less than 2.5 mm, neither should the stem diameter exceed  one-thirtieth of the test-duct diameter. Ten readings should be taken along  each of two diameters of the duct at right angles to each other at the traverse  section, the measuring points being located at distances of 0.052, 0.163,  0.293, 0.452 and 0.684 times the radius of the duct from the wall with a  tolerance of 0.5% of the radius. Whereas the average static pressure is given  by the arithmetic mean of the static pressure readings at the points of  observation, the average velocity pressure can also be calculated. <br />
       The fan  velocity pressure is the velocity pressure at the fan outlet and can be  calculated from the relation</p>

       where &rho;  is the density of the air at the fan inlet, T and T0 are the  dry-bulb temperatures at the fan inlet and in the duct respectively, B is the  barometric pressure measured in the duct in Pa.<br />
       T0,  T, B and Ps are measured, the barometer reading, of course, being  corrected for temperature whereas &rho; can be easily calculated. For fans  generating up to 1 kPa pressure, &rho;0 &nbsp;can be taken equal to &rho;. The quantity  circulating in the duct can be calculated by multiplying v0 by A0.<br />
       The fan  total pressure indicates the total pressure at the outlet of the fan and can be  calculated by adding the pressure loss in the intervening duct as well as that  in the straightener to the sum of the static and the velocity pressures measured  in the duct. Pressure loss in the duct is given by the realtion</p>
