     <h4><strong><u>Procedure:</u></strong><u> </u></h4>
     <ol>
     <ul>
       <li>The dimensions of the duct&nbsp;and tubs are taken.</li>
       <li>The cover of the duct is closed and the duct is made  air tight with the help of putty (after placing the tubs).</li>
       <li>The two ends of the DP Calc.&nbsp;are connected to the  pressure tapping ends of the duct. </li>
       <li>Fan is started.</li>
       <li>The corresponding pressure loss reading is taken with  the help of DP Calc.</li>
       <li>Anemometer traversing is done to measure the air  velocity at the end of the duct, three readings are taken from which average  velocity is found out.</li>
       <li>Step 5&amp; 6 are repeated for certain number of times,  maintaining different flow conditions each time with the help of flow regulator  (throttling devices).</li>
       <li>&nbsp;Shock pressure  losses are determined for each flow condition. Finally, a graph is&nbsp;plotted  between shock pressure losses vs.<img src="procedure_clip_image002.gif" alt="5" width="81" height="47" align="absmiddle" />&nbsp;to find out the drag co-efficient. <strong><u></u></strong></li>
     </ul>
