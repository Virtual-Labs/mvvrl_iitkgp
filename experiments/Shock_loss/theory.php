     <p><strong>Determination  of shock pressure loss in presence of tub<u> </u></strong><br />
       </p>
     <p><strong><u>Objective:</u></strong><br />
       The  purpose of this experiment is to find out the amount of shock pressure loss  occurs when a tub is present in the path of air flow. This experiment will also  allow to determine the drag co-efficient (CD) of shock pressure  losses in presence of a single tub.<br />
  </p>
     <p><strong><u>Theory: </u></strong><br />
       The  pressure loss in fluid flow (PL) has two components: the  friction loss (PF) and the shock loss (PX).  Friction losses occur due to shear resistance between boundary wall of the duct  and fluid flow as well as individual layers of viscous fluid. While shock  losses are resulted mainly due to expansion and contraction of the duct, change  in flow direction and presence of the obstruction in the flow path. Shock  losses also occur at the inlet and outlet of system and at the junction of any  air currents. Although friction loss constitutes major component of the  pressure loss in a ventilation system, the shock losses may reach up to 30% of  the total pressure loss (Mcpherson, year). <strong></strong><br />
       In  presence of an obstruction in a fluid flow path, shock losses occur due to  development of drag forces that acts in the direction opposite to the flow  direction. Unlike frictional forces these losses are proportional to velocity.  There are two types of drag forces: form drag and friction drag<br />
        </p>
     <p><strong><em>Form drag:</em></strong> These drag losses are due to the shape or formation of the object i.e. bodies  with larger cross-section will have a higher drag loss than thin streamline  bodies. Form drag losses follow the drag equation i.e. they are proportional to  square of velocity.<br />
        </p>
     <p><strong><em>Friction drag:</em></strong> These drag losses are associated with the interaction of object surface with  fluid, and thus arises from the Van-der-wall or adhesive forces acting on it  (Banerjee, 2003).<br />
       The  mechanism of the formation of drag forces is explained in the different text  books (Misra, 1985; Banerjee, 2003; Hartman et al., 1997; Mcpherson, 1993). A  brief presentation referring to Banerjee (2003) is outlined here. In case, an  object is immersed in a moving fluid, it experiences a drag force which tends  to move the body longitudinally with the flow. A part of this force occurs due  to friction drag caused by the sheer force of the moving fluid at the boundary  of the obstruction; the other part of the drag force is due to the creation of  unbalanced normal forces at the leading and the trailing ends of the  obstruction and is called form drag or pressure drag. <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below explains  the formation of drag forces around a cylindrical body immersed in a  incompressible flow of real fluid. A thin boundary wall is created around the  cylinder in zone of flow. Due to increase in the velocity on the side of the  cylinder, the pressure will reduce continuously from point A to B. Thus a fluid  element within the boundary layer experiences a net pressure force in the  direction of the flow. This net pressure force overcomes the resisting sheer  force and allows maintaining the motion of the element in the flow direction.  The situation is different when an element of fluid within the boundary wall  but beyond point B is considered. The fluid element now experiences a net  pressure force in a direction opposite to its motion. It continues for some  distance for its momentum, beyond which, the layer adjacent to the solid  surface is brought to rest and separation of flow takes place. The boundary  layer separation creates a relative low pressure region behind a body and this  region is called wake. Thus for separated flow, there is a net imbalance of  pressure which is the cause of form drag. <br />
      The  drag forces developed depend upon the Reynolds Number (Re) and the geometry of  obstruction. A dimensionless co-efficient, called, drag co-efficient is used to  characterize the obstruction and flow condition pertaining to drag losses. The  drag forces are found to vary with the frontal area of obstruction present in a  fluid flow, velocity of the fluid and the density of the fluid. The drag force  can be expressed by the following expression:&nbsp;</p>

       Where, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S = Frontal area of the body<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="theory_clip_image006.gif" alt="36" width="10" height="22" />&nbsp;= density of air<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="theory_clip_image008.gif" alt="75" width="9" height="22" />&nbsp;= velocity of air<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
     <p>The drag force causes a static  pressure loss (DP)  in the air flow stream. If A is the area of the duct in which the obstruction  is placed, (DP.A) must equal to the drag force.  So, the equation becomes:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><img src="theory_clip_image010.gif" alt="78" width="126" height="41" /> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
  <img src="theory_clip_image012.gif" alt="69" width="166" height="41" /> </p>
     <p>Hence, the shock pressure due to  presence of an obstruction can be experimentally determined by measuring shock  pressure loss and the co-efficient of drag for a particular obstruction  geometry can be found out using above equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
